## Project Overview


## Purpose and Inspiration
This project was built for the client Jay Padrnos who wanted to see if he wanted to learn C++ without buying a course, but also be hands on with his learning. 

## Technologies
TypeScript:
TypeScript is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript, developed by Microsoft to catch common errors early in the development process. It allows developers to specify types for variables and function parameters, providing better tooling and documentation. Once TypeScript code is written, it's compiled into JavaScript, enabling it to run in any JavaScript environment.

## Functionality and Features
I made the decision to use dangerouslySetInnerHTML for this particular project because the data being loaded into the application is static and fully under my control, which eliminates the risk of XSS attacks. However, I'm fully aware of the security implications and in a production application where user-generated or external data is being handled, I would certainly use a different approach to mitigate security risks.
