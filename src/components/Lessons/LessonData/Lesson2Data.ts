        disc: `In any journey of learning a programming language like C++, it's essential to understand that the environment where you write and execute your code plays a crucial role. In this context, setting up your personal computer (PC) for coding is a vital first step before diving deeper into the world of C++. This set-up isn't merely about having a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE); it's about crafting a workspace that fits your needs and helps you become more productive and efficient. One might question why this is necessary when there are countless online platforms offering embedded IDEs that let you write and run code directly in your web browser. While these are excellent tools for quick tasks or learning on the go, they are fundamentally different from running code on your own machine.

        disc: `Firstly, an embedded IDE generally runs your code on a remote server, not your own PC. While this makes it platform-independent, it can sometimes lead to differences in the behavior of your code due to variations in the server's configuration. In contrast, when you run code on your own PC, you have full control over the environment and can better understand and debug any issues that may arise. <br></br>
        
        
        Secondly, setting up your own environment aids in learning about the inner workings of a computer and the compiler, which is a crucial part of the C++ learning journey. By installing a compiler and running your code, you get firsthand experience of how source code is transformed into an executable program. This experience is vital in understanding compilation errors and their resolutions, which is not usually the case with an embedded IDE.`

        disc: `Lastly, setting up your own coding environment on your PC gives you a real-world feel of a programmer's job. In the professional world, developers seldom use embedded IDEs for full-fledged software development. They instead rely on locally installed IDEs and compilers for more flexibility, control, and efficiency. <br></br>
        
        In conclusion, while online, browser-based IDEs are convenient, there's a lot more to gain from setting up and running code on your own PC. It gives you more control, a deeper understanding of how your code interacts with the system, and a more realistic experience of what programming is like in a professional setting.`

        SlideTitle: "Embracing External Resources and the Art of Troubleshooting in Programming",
        disc: `In your journey to master C++, it's crucial to understand that seeking help from external resources is not only common but also an integral part of the programming process. At times, you may encounter hurdles that may not be immediately solvable with your current knowledge base. Don't be discouraged - even seasoned developers frequently turn to platforms like Stack Overflow, online documentation, or AI-powered assistants for help. <br></br>
        
        These resources offer a vast pool of collective knowledge that can help you debug code, understand complex concepts, and learn best practices. Remember, it's not just about finding solutions to your problems, it's about understanding those solutions, the mistakes that led to the problems, and how to avoid them in the future. Troubleshooting is a fundamental skill in software development. It involves being able to identify the problem, understand it, and come up with an effective solution - often by leveraging resources available to you.`

        disc: `As you progress through this "Learn C++" course, remember that our aim is to provide a comprehensive introduction to C++. However, the vast landscape of programming can't be entirely covered in a single course. It's expected, and indeed encouraged, that you'll seek additional information from other resources to deepen your understanding and solve the challenges posed in the lessons. Embrace these opportunities to learn from the global developer community and supplement your learning journey. After all, becoming a skilled developer is as much about problem-solving and continuous learning as it is about writing code.`
