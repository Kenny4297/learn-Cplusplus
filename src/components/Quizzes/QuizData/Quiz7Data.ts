        question: "What are arrays and vectors?",

        answer1: "Both are data types used for storing elements of different types",
        answer2: "An array is a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type, while a vector is a dynamic-size collection which can grow or shrink as needed",
        answer3: "Arrays and vectors are both types of pointers",
        answer4: "Vectors are a type of array with extra features",

        correct: "An array is a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type, while a vector is a dynamic-size collection which can grow or shrink as needed"
